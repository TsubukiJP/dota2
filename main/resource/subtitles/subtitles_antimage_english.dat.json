    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_228": "Yeah, but like...could ANYONE weave new threads of reality, or do you need special mandibles?",
    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_229": "Oh man, remember when we killed that necromancer?  Fun times.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_230": "We'll see who gets there first, Lyralei.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_231": "Hope you fight better than you write poems...",
    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_232": "So.  Auroth.  I've read some of your stuff.  It's uh... it's very... verbose.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_235": "I'm watching you, Osterion...",
    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_236": "If my mentor finds out I'm helping Osterion he's gonna kill me...",
    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_237": "I'm not your type Zeus, I have self respect.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_238": "Oh good.  Skeezy older men.  I really missed those when I was training in a cave...",
    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_239": "Alright kid, if you ask nicely I'll let you be my ward.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_240": "Stick with me kid, I won't let them hurt you.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_300": "I don't say this often...but I could really learn a thing or two from you.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_301": "Of course I think it's a sad story. But that doesn't take away from the horrible things you've done.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_302": "I didn't know these came in the friendly variety.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_303_02": "So I had an idea for like, an obstacle course where the obstacles try to kill you.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_304": "I figured we'd make a good team.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_ally_305": "So... What can you do?",

    "antimage_amp_wei_taunt_01": "You wanna see something really cool?",
    "antimage_amp_wei_taunt_02": "The Anti-Mage was right. Practice really does make perfect. Well, pretty close.",

    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_01": "Just meditate on this for a while. It won't help, but what else have you got?",
    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_02": "I told you from the top how this was gonna go.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_03": "Can you bring your friends next time? Lot quicker if I can kill you all in one place.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_04": "I always leave the hellbear cubs alone. They're pretty cute and, ya know, I'll be back this way again...",
    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_05": "I didn't spend all this time training just to hit creeps. But damned if it isn't hypnotic...",
    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_06": "If I ever drop a thy or thine just end me right there.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_07": "You can't catch me, you can't beat me, you can't run from me.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_08": "You might not guess it, but I didn't spend much time around other kids.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_09": "I thought all this was supposed to be harder than training...",
    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_10": "It's called aptitude.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_11": "Didn't they tell you I was here?",
    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_12": "I don't hate you. But that doesn't mean you're getting out of here alive.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_13": "It's the little things in life...",
    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_14": "I wouldn't call that a win for you.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_15": "I think you've had enough.",
    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_16": "What was your goal in all this?",
    "antimage_amp_wei_wheel_all_17": "The scary thing is you think you're good at this.",
